<h3> Kitabuk | Digital Diary </h3>

<p> This prototype digital diary exists as part of a research project aimed at understanding 
    a high-level set of guidelines to develop an engaging online 
    digital diary system to meet usersâ€™ expectations.</p>

<p>  Caregiving can be a heavy burden for many people and the emotional side of caregiving can surface soon after an individual takes on caregiving duties.
     creating a web-based diary that enables caregivers to self-report their emotions, reducing their burden and alleviating their stress, 
     is crucial for a digitised future and a caregiver's future</p>

<p> 
    My hope is that I can develop Kitabuk | Digital Diary further than this research project,
    so that it can be recognised as the go-to digital diary within the caregiver community. It is a project 
    that I am very proud of and I am excited to share it with you all.
